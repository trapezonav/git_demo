The gypsy woman told my mother
Before I was born
I got a boy child's coming
He's gonna be a son of a gun
He gonna make pretty womens
Jump and shout
Then the world wanna know
What this all about

But you know I'm him
Everybody knows I'm him
Well, you know I'm a Hoochie Coochie Man
Yeah, everybody knows I'm him
